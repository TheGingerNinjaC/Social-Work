# South African Social Work System
## tl;dr
As a former social worker and a current developer, I am interested in how I can make social work better with technology. 

## The Beginning...
When I was a social worker, something that annoyed me was that everything was paper-based.  I'm talking client files, appointments, calendars, staff administration, etc. It is no surprise that things would be misplaced, and if you didn't have proof of an interaction, then it simply didn't happen. One of the reasons why I changed careers is that I wanted to be able to understand how to develop a system and use this knowledge to improve the processes for social workers and their clients.

## The Plan
For the initial stages, I will mostly be working in the Wiki to document my process.  At the moment it is just for fun and I will be putting an emphasis on the SDLC and converting forms into tables.
